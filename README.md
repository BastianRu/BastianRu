# Hi, I'm Sebastian 👋
### Computer Science Student | Machine Learning Core & AI Engineering

I am a passionate Computer Science student at **Universidad del Cauca**, currently in my 5th semester. My focus is on understanding the **mathematical and theoretical foundations** of Artificial Intelligence, moving beyond high-level abstractions to build systems from the ground up.

---

## 🔬 The "From Scratch" Philosophy
I believe that true mastery of AI comes from understanding the gradients. My work focuses on implementing core architectures using only low-level tensor operations, avoiding high-level "black box" libraries whenever possible.

- **Current Goal:** Full implementation of "Attention is All You Need" (Transformers) from scratch.
- **Academic Honors:** - 🏆 **Two-time Academic Merit Scholarship** (Highest GPA in the program).
  - 🥇 **National Academic Excellence Recognition (Ranked 1st in High School Standardized Exam).

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🧠 [Probabilistic Neural Language Model](https://github.com/BastianRu/Deep-Learning-Foundations-From-Scratch-Journal/blob/main/04-Probabilistic_Neural_Language_Model/ProbabilisticNeuralLModel.ipynb)
A PyTorch implementation of the seminal **Bengio et al. (2003)** paper. Focuses on word feature vectors (embeddings) and distributed representations before the Transformer era.

## 📈 My Learning Path
- 📖 **Paper Reading:** Deeply studying "Attention is All You Need" and historical SOTA papers.
- 🏗️ **Architectures:** Moving from MLPs to Transformers and GPT-style models.
